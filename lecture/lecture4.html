    <h1>Plot</h1>
    <article>
        In 3102 BC, following the Kurukshetra War, Ashwatthama attempts to kill Uttarā's unborn child by invoking the Brahmashirastra, a godly weapon of unimaginable destruction. For committing the act, Krishna, the 8th reincarnation of Vishnu, curses him to roam the earth as an immortal and witness humanity's misery as a result of societal and moral deterioration in the Kali Yuga. His divine gem is also taken from his forehead, and his redemption is destined to occur through protecting the mother of Vishnu's next reincarnation, Kalki, towards the end of Kali Yuga.

   <h1>Production</h1>
   <article>Karna, now revealed to be reincarnated as Bhairava, temporarily awakens in Bhairava and defends Sumathi and Ashwatthama against the Raiders. Bhairava uses the bow to rescue Sumathi and kill Manas. Ashwatthama, recognising his brother, breaks free, but Bhairava reverts to his former self due to a distraction caused by Bujji and takes Sumathi away. Back at the Complex, Yaskin is informed of Manas's failure by Counsellor Bani. He uses the extracted serum to transform into a much younger superhuman. He picks up Arjuna's bow, Gandiva, and declares to personally capture Sumathi and her child to reshape the world.</article>
